### UCB - AIML Capstone Project: Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction### Executive Summary**Project Overview and Goals:**The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of heart attack occurrence in patients using machine learning models based on various health metrics and medical history data. By accurately identifying high-risk individuals, healthcare providers can take preventative measures and provide timely interventions. We will train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective one for predicting heart attack risk.## Table of Contents1.

This will aid in early diagnosis and potentially save lives by allowing timely medical intervention.### Key Findings- **Best Model:** The Random Forest model was identified as the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.- **Significant Risk Factors:** Age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise-induced angina were found to be the most significant predictors of heart attacks.## Data DescriptionThe dataset includes the following features:- **Age:** Age of the patient- **Sex:** Gender of the patient- **cp:** Chest pain type (4 values)- **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)- **chol:** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl- **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)- **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved- **exang:** Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest- **slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment- **ca:** Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy- **thal:** Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)- **target:** Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)## Project Outline### 1. Data Loading and Exploration- **Loading Dataset:** The dataset is loaded using pandas.- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the distribution of features, checking for missing values, and basic statistical analysis.### 2. Data Preprocessing- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies such as mean imputation or removing rows with missing values.- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Using techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical features.- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.- **Train-Test Split:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.### 3. Model Training and Evaluation- **Model Selection:** Training various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model.- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.### 4. Results and Conclusion- **Best Model Identification:** Random Forest model identified as the best based on evaluation metrics.- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyzing which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.### 5. Visualization- **Data Distribution:** Visualizing the distribution of key features.- **Model Performance:** Plotting ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importances.- **Feature Importance:** Highlighting the most significant predictors of heart attacks.## Project ConclusionThe activities we carried out within the scope of the project are as follows:- **Data Preparation:** Made the dataset ready for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**   - Analyzed numerical and categorical variables using Distplot and Pie Chart graphics.  - Performed bivariate analysis using FacetGrid, Count Plot, Pair Plot, Swarm plot, Box plot, and Heatmap graphics.- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing and outlier values.- **Modeling:** Used four different algorithms in the model phase:  - **Logistic Regression Model:** Achieved 87% accuracy and 88% AUC.  - **Decision Tree Model:** Achieved 83% accuracy and 85% AUC.  - **Support Vector Classifier Model:** Achieved 83% accuracy and 89% AUC.  - **Random Forest Classifier Model:** Achieved 90.3% accuracy and 93% AUC.When evaluating all these model outputs, the Random Forest model was preferred as it gave the best results. See you in the next project.## Future WorkThis project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart attacks and identifying key risk factors. Future work could involve:- **Collecting More Data:** To improve model accuracy and generalizability.- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that might better capture the risk factors.- **Advanced Models:** Exploring deep learning models or ensemble methods to enhance prediction accuracy.- **Real-Time Prediction:** Developing a real-time prediction system for use in clinical settings.### References- [Up-to-date Heart Attack Analysis And Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/oaktechacademy/up-to-date-heart-attack-analysis-and-prediction)- [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)## How to Run the Notebook1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:   ```bash   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn   ```2. **Load the Dataset:** Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.3. **Run the Notebook:** Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.4. **Visualize Results:** Use the provided visualizations to gain insights into the data and model performance.---This README provides a comprehensive overview of the heart attack analysis and prediction project, including dataset details, methodology, results, and future directions.
